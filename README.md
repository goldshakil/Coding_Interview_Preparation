# Coding Interview Preparation
This repository is targeted towards getting ready for coding interviews in Java and Python


## More on **Daily Practice** section in the coding guide:
1- Refer to chapters (1-8) and chapter 10 in Cracking the Coding Interview book.
2- For each chapter, solve its relevant problems in https://neetcode.io/ and https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/
3- Start with Easy problems and move toward medium and hard problems as you get more comfortable.

## More on **Programming Patterns Notes** section in the coding guide:
This [repo]([url](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns)) has some more helpful and useful notes regarding programming patterns.

## Ress=ources to use for reference:
Cracking the Coding Interview Book, I personally refer to this book for only revising DS and Algo fundamentals and not for solving the problems listed in the book.
