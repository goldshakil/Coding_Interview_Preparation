# Coding Interview Preparation
This repository is targeted towards getting ready for coding interviews in Java and Python


## More on **Daily Practice** section in the coding guide:
1. Refer to chapters (1-8) and chapter 10 in Cracking the Coding Interview book.
2. For each chapter, solve its relevant problems in https://neetcode.io/ and https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/
3. Start with Easy problems and move towards medium and hard problems as you get more comfortable.
4. If you are done with both lists, finish up the remaining problems in Top 100 Liked Questions on LeetCode.
5. If you are also fone with the Top 100 Liked Questions, finish up the remaining problems in Top Interview Questions on LeetCode.
6. And before your interviews, get premium on LeetCode and solve the top problems in the company you're applying for on LeetCode.

## More on **Programming Patterns Notes** section in the coding guide:
This [repo]([url](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns)) has some more helpful and useful notes regarding programming patterns.

## Resources to use for reference:
Cracking the Coding Interview Book, I personally refer to this book for only revising DS and Algo fundamentals and not for solving the problems listed in the book.
